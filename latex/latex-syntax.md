# Fractions and Binomials[edit]

분수

A fraction is created using the `\frac{numerator}{denominator}` command. 
(for those who need their memories refreshed, that's the top and bottom respectively!). Likewise, the binomial coefficient (aka the Choose function) may be written using the \binom command

```
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
{\displaystyle {\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}={\binom {n}{k}}} {\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}={\binom {n}{k}}
```
